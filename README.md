# Tailwind CSS Gradient Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. The gradient isn't displaying as expected. The problem arises from an incorrect implementation of the gradient utility classes.

## Problem

The initial code uses Tailwind's gradient classes but fails to produce the desired gradient effect. This is likely due to a misunderstanding or misuse of Tailwind's gradient syntax, or a conflict with other CSS rules.

## Solution

The solution showcases the correct usage of Tailwind gradient classes or demonstrates a fallback using standard CSS linear-gradient. This approach ensures that the gradient renders properly and addresses the issue.
